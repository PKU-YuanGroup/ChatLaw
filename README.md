# ChatLaw Models

## ChatLaw2-MoE

- **Latest Version**: Based on the InternLM architecture with a 4x7B Mixture of Experts (MoE) design.

- **Specialization**: Tailored for Chinese legal language processing、

## ChatLaw-13B

- **Demo Version**: Built on the Ziya-LLaMA-13B-v1 model.
- **Performance**: Excels in general Chinese tasks but requires a larger model for complex legal QA.

## ChatLaw-33B

- **Demo Version**: Utilizes the Anima-33B model.
- **Enhancements**: Improved logical reasoning over the 13B version.
- **Challenge**: Occasionally defaults to English responses due to limited Chinese training data in Anima.

## ChatLaw-Text2Vec

- **Function**: A text similarity model trained on 93,000 court case decisions.
- **Capability**: Matches user queries to pertinent legal statutes, offering contextual relevance.
- **Example**: Connects questions about loan repayment to the appropriate sections of contract law.


## Introduction

AI legal assistants, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), offer accessible legal consulting. However, the risk of hallucination in AI responses is a concern. This paper introduces ChatLaw, an innovative assistant that employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model and a multi-agent system to enhance reliability and accuracy in AI legal services. By integrating knowledge graphs and artificial screening, we've created a high-quality legal dataset for training the MoE model. This model leverages various experts to address a range of legal issues, optimizing legal response accuracy. Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs), inspired by law firm workflows, significantly minimize errors and hallucinations.

Our MoE model outperforms GPT-4 in the Lawbench and Unified Qualification Exam for Legal Professionals, achieving a 7.73% higher accuracy and an 11-point lead, respectively. It also surpasses other models in real-case consultations across multiple dimensions, showcasing robust legal consultation capabilities.

### Multi-Agents Collaboration Process and Legal Consultation Report

The diagram below illustrates the collaborative process of multiple agents in providing legal consultation services, exemplified by a divorce consultation. The process involves gathering information, legal research, comprehensive advice, and culminates in a detailed Legal Consultation Report.
